# PA02: tracker.py and the Transaction class

This application is a CLI that allows a user to interface with a SQLite3 database through Python. 

The `Transaction` class is ORM, and has various CRUD operations, as well as contextual summarizations, for the `transactions` table in `tracker.db`.

The `tracker.py` script has been updated to include this new functionality, as well as a new print statement to accomodate for the new table.

Transcripts for proof of concept for this assignment can be found in `./transcripts`.
